# Latinum Agentic Commerce: MCP Wallet + 402 Facilitator

**Latinum** is a payment middleware that enables MCP builders to monetize their services.

Over the past few months, developers have built thousands of MCP servers—but there’s been no way to get paid. Latinum introduces an MCP-compatible wallet that allows agents to autonomously pay for the services they consume.

### Why It Matters

Imagine using a tool like **Cursor**, which relies on a dozen backend services (e.g., Figma, deployment platforms). Normally, you'd need to:

* Sign up for each service manually
* Manage billing
* Copy API tokens into the MCP config

With Latinum, all of that disappears. Agents can:

* Manage their own budget
* Generate signed transactions
* Pay per request with a single API call

This is just the beginning. In the coming years, most digital transactions—ordering groceries, booking a ride—will be made by agents on behalf of humans.

### 🧠 How It Works

When an agent like **Cursor** or **Claude** calls an MCP tool with a Paywall Service, the MCP responds with a payment requirement. The agent then:

1. Uses the **Latinum Wallet MCP** to generate a **signed transaction**.
2. Repeats the request to the MCP, now including the signed payload.
3. The MCP verifies the payment by contacting the **Latinum Facilitator**, which:
   - Validates the transaction on-chain
   - Confirms receipt of funds
4. If valid, the MCP proceeds to fulfill the original request.

This enables **autonomous, API-level payments** between agents and service providers.

## ✨ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennj/latinum-colosseum.git
cd latinum-colosseum
```

### 2. Run the Facilitator

```bash
cd latinum-server
npm install
```

Add your env:

```env
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
```

Then start the server:

```bash
npx nitro dev
```

## 🤖 MCP Configuration (Claude)

Update your Claude `claude.desktop.json` config to register the two MCPs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "buy_stuff_server": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/workspace/buy_stuff_mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/Users/yourname/workspace/buy_stuff_mcp/server.py"
      ]
    },
    "latinum_wallet_mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/workspace/latinum_wallet_mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/Users/yourname/workspace/latinum_wallet_mcp/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the right path.

Make sure both `latinum_wallet_mcp` and `buy_stuff_mcp` have working virtual environments and proper `.env` configuration.

## 🍚 Try It Out

Once both MCPs are running, open Claude and ask:

> *"Buy me some oranges."*

The agent will:

1. Discover the product
2. Request a signed payment payload from the wallet
3. Submit the signed payload to the facilitator
4. Complete the purchase ✅
